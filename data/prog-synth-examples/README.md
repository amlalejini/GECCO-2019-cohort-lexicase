# Programming Synthesis Benchmark Data

This directory contains .csv files with the training and testing examples for
the general programming synthesis benchmarks (Helmuth and Spector, 2015). The
examples here are copied from the github repository containing the examples from
(Helmuth and Spector, 2015); however, here, I have separated training and testing
examples into separate files for each problem.
